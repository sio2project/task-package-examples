    \noindent A tree is a connected, undirected and unweighted graph,
    consisting of $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges.
    The characteristic feature of the tree is that it is connected and acyclic.
    A leaf in a tree is a vertex that has its degree equal to 1
    (that is, only one edge is incident to it).
    If a rooted tree is given, it means that a certain designated vertex is a root.
    It is assumed that in a rooted tree the root is not called a leaf
    (even if its degree is equal to 1).
    You are given a $n$ - vertex rooted tree.
    The root is the vertex with index 1.
    Your task is to calculate the number of it's leaves.

\section{Input}

    In the first line of input one number $n$ ($n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) is given,
    denoting the number of vertices of the tree.
    The next $n-1$ lines contain information about the edges in the tree.
    There are two different numbers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$)
    given on the $i$-th line, denoting vertices connected by the $i$-th edge.

\section{Output}

    Output one number - number of leaves.
