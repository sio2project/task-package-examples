  As we all know, every Christmas tree consists of exactly three parts,
  in their descending order: upper crown, lower crown, and the trunk.
  Each part of tree crown is represented by an isosceles triangle 1 character wide
  at the top and growing by 1 character in both directions (left and right) 
  with each line, going downwards.
  A Christmas tree will be said to be of size $n$ if its upper crown
  is $n$ lines tall and its lower crown is $n + 1$ lines tall. 
  The trunk is always 2 characters tall and 1 character wide, located on
  the tree's vertical axis, regardless of the overall tree size.
  In this problem you'll be asked to print a Christmas tree of given size,
  represented by hashes on a dotted background.

  \section{Input}

    A single integer $n$ ($n \leq 1\,000$) denoting the size of the tree.

  \section{Output}

    If $n=0$, print only one line saying "Too small to exist".\\
    Otherwise, print $2*n+3$ lines, $2*n+1$ characters each, representing a drawing 
    of an $n$â€“sized Christmas tree, as described in the problem statement.
    Check out the examples in order to get a better understanding of the output format.
